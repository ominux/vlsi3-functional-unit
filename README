README file for using tcl scripts

syntax:

primetime: from the pt_scripts directory
pt_shell -file <filename>.tcl

design compiler: can compile just the ALU or the entire FU
									execute this script from the synthesis directory
dc_shell-t -f compile_<block>.tcl

vcs: be sure to include your design files in the testbench file, outside the module,
									execute this from the same directory as the design files

vcs +v2k <testbench_filename>.v
then you can run the 'simv' executable that is placed in the same directory

notes:
do not place the pdk database in the SVN repository
