TOOL LIST

primetime: 

	description:	Can do power analysis of an individual block or can run it on the 
								entire functional unit.  Execute the primetime scripts from the 
								pt_scripts directory.

	syntax:				pt_shell -file <filename>.tcl

	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/primetime/primetime.cshrc

design compiler: 

	description:	Each individual block can be compiled separately or the entire
								functional unit can be compiled for a better synthesis. To run
								synthesis, execute these scripts from the synthesis directory.

	syntax:				dc_shell-t -f compile_<block>.tcl

	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/synopsys_syn/synopsys_syn.cshrc

vcs: 

	description:	Run VCS from the same directory as the design files (verilog/synthesis).
								Be sure to include your design files in the testbench file.  The simv
								executable file is then created in that same directory.  Run simv to
								run the testbench.

	syntax:				vcs +v2k <testbench_filename>.v
								simv
	
	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/vcs/vcs.cshrc

encounter:

	description:	Run Encounter from the schematic directory.  You can then import a
								design and specify all the necessary files relative to that schematic
								directory.  If you are missing any files, you can get them from the 
								locations specified below in ~cbolson1/vlsi_fu/.

	demo:					/s0/robin/cp65npksdsta03/demo/pnr/soce/

	syntax:				encounter

	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/cadence_soc/soc.cshrc

	locations:		lib:	$ROOT/schematic/lib/
								db:		$ROOT/synthesis/db/
								sdb:	$ROOT/synthesis/sdb/
								lef:	$ROOT/schematic/lef/

	uncertain:		capTable = "captables/${mStack}/${mStack}_captables.dat" 
								coreOr = aspect

	steps:				design->import_design
								floorplan->specify floorplan->Ratio,coreUtilization,core_to_boundary, Advanced->Row Height
								floorplan->connect global nets
								power->power planning->add rings (use M4/5 width=8,space=1,offset=1)
								power->power planning->add stripes (M5,horizontal,width=8,space=1,Y offset from bottom=5)
								route->special route-> deselect pad pins
								place->standard cells and blocks
								place->filler->add filler
								route->NanoRoute->route
								verify->verify geometery
								save -> gds

V2LVS
	
	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/pkgs/calibre/calibre.cshrc

	syntax:				v2lvs -i -v ../synthesis/<cellname>.vh -s0 VSS -s1 VDD -s design_model.inc -o <cellname>.sp -lsr cp65npksdst.lvs
