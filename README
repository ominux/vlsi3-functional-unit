TOOL LIST

primetime: 

	description:	Can do power analysis of an individual block or can run it on the 
								entire functional unit.  Execute the primetime scripts from the 
								pt_scripts directory.

	syntax:				pt_shell -file <filename>.tcl

	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/primetime/primetime.cshrc

design compiler: 

	description:	Each individual block can be compiled separately or the entire
								functional unit can be compiled for a better synthesis. To run
								synthesis, execute these scripts from the synthesis directory.

	syntax:				dc_shell-t -f compile_<block>.tcl

	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/synopsys_syn/synopsys_syn.cshrc

vcs: 

	description:	Run VCS from the same directory as the design files (verilog/synthesis).
								Be sure to include your design files in the testbench file.  The simv
								executable file is then created in that same directory.  Run simv to
								run the testbench.

	syntax:				vcs +v2k <testbench_filename>.v
								simv
	
	setup:				source /usr/nikola/groups/vlsi/pkgs/vcs/vcs.cshrc
